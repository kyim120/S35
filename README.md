## ðŸŽ› Components

* **Switches (S1â€“S4):** Toggle switches used to activate each relay circuit.
* **Resistors (R1â€“R4):** Limit current to protect relays.
* **Relays (K1â€“K4):** Electromagnetic switches (K1â€“K3 = 6V, K4 = 3V).
* **Ammeter (A):** Measures total current from active branches.

## âš™ How It Works

1. Toggle any **switch** (S1 to S4).
2. Current flows through its **resistor** (R1â€“R4).
3. Energizes the corresponding **relay** (K1â€“K4).
4. The relay closes, sending current via a **yellow wire** to the **ammeter**.
5. **Ammeter** measures total current depending on how many relays are active.
6. Current returns to ground completing the loop.
